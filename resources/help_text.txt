Before you begin, you must acquire a MOSS identification number. This allows you to use the moss servers, even without the aid of this gui. To obtain a Moss account, send a mail message to moss@moss.stanford.edu. The body of the message should appear exactly as follows:

registeruser
mail username@domain

where the last bit in italics is your email address.

Once registered, you will receive an email with your registration number, instructions on how to use moss through terminal commands (some of which will be cited within this document), and the moss script, if you decide to use it instead of this program. It is advised that you save this email, or at least, save your identification number in a secure location. This program will automatically save your preferences (such as your identification number) in a config file stored locally. This file may reset if the file becomes corrupted.

Settings Tab
- - Submission Panel: These settings will affect how moss computes its matches
- - - - Language: moss can only compare one language at a time. Use this drop-down menu to select which coding language you are using to submit.

- - - - Moss ID: Enter your moss ID in this box. An invalid ID will fail to submit.

- - - - Ignore Limit: This number represents the amount of times a similarity can occur before it is marked to be ignored. This may be helpful in filtering similarities that arise due to taught coding styles or hainvg only one solution to certain aspects of the problem (strict api's, sockets, etc.)

- - - - Directory Mode: Toggle on to active. This is useful for projects with multiple files. This directs moss to treat all files in the same directory as a single submission. The files must have the same name for moss to compare the files. It will continue to work even if one directory is missing files.

- - Report Panel: These settings will affect how the gui handles the report generated by moss
- - - - Filter Report: Useful for further identifying plagiarism groups. The filter generates networks of matches based off of transitivity/readability (if A matches with B and B matches with C, then A,B, and C are all grouped in a network). The filter also examines whether or not matched students were partners (as some pairs submit code twice) and mark them as such. Filtering also supports cross-quarter/year comparisons, and will filter out networks solely comprised of students from previous quarters, or a network generated from a single match between partners. Activating this mode will enable the Partners Tab and Network Lower Threshold.

- - - - Network Lower Threshold: Matches that fall below this percentage for code similarity in will automatically be removed from the report. Set to 0 to disable.

- - - - Download Report: This allows the user to download a copy of the generated report (filtered or unfiltered).

- - - - Archive Locally: This allows you to archive the report in its entirety. This method will crawl through each match and download the resources necessary to view the report in its entirety even after the 10 day expiration date is reached (graphics, or the colored match bars, are not downloaded and require an internet connection to be viewed, but are not essential to the report).

- - - - Zip Report: once downloaded, this will automatically compress the report into a zip archive.


Files Tab:
- - Tree View: This will help organize and display files you add to the moss file manager, allowing you to verify their addition and remove all or specific files if necessary.

- - - - Base Files: Add all files that were provided to the students. Moss will ignore similarities between student submissions that arise from these files.

- - - - Current Student Submissions: Files that will be submitted to moss to compare. If using the filter report mode, matches form these files will be compared against the partners list and marked appropriately.

- - - - Past Student Submissions: Files that will be submitted to moss to compare. If using the filter report mode, matches from these files will be ignored unless they are connected to current students.

- - - - Display Name: The name displayed within the report and the name used to check against the partner list.

- - - - Path: The OS path to the file (to ensure the correct files were selected). Using the "Add Directory of Zips" and "Add Checkmate Directory" modes will create a temporary directory and therefore the displayed path will not match the path to the original copies.

- - - - Removing Files: You may double click on a file to remove it. You may also double click on an entire file addition operation to remove all of the files discovered by it, or double click on the file category itself to remove all files of that type.

- - Add Files Panel: Used to bring up the file selector dialogues. RegEx (Display Name): The Regular Expression used to modify each file's display name for batch file selections (Add by directory, by wildcard, etc.). The program will use group 1 as the name. https://regex101.com is a good tool for testing your regular expressions (use the python mode). By Default, the dialogue will autocomplete to use the file's entire original name: (.*)

- - - - Add Single File: Used to add a single file to the file manager. You may browse for the file using your OS's built in file browser, or may paste in the path. The Display name may be modified here, and the category to add the file to may be selected.

- - - - Add Directory of Files: Used to add all files within a single directory (non-recursive). Uses regular expression to identify each file's display name.

- - - - Add Directory of Zip Files: Used to add a directory containing zip files to the file manager. You may specify the name(s) of the file(s) within the zip file to submit semi-colon delineated, or may leave it blank to select all files. Uses the zip file's name to run the display name regex against.

- - - - Add by Wildcard: Used to add files following a certain pattern. Use "*" for single level, and "**" for recursive structures. Example: "/Users/Downloads/student_submissions/*/labs/**.py", will look in the student_submissions folder and scan all folders within that contain a labs folder, selecting any py file it finds within any labs directory it finds or any sub-directories of the labs folders.

- - - - Add Checkmate Directory: Used to add files from a directory download off of checkmate (unzipped directory). Use Directory Mode with this Selection.

Partners Tab:
    #### IMPORTANT ####

    NOTE: If you do not wish to create your own script, or need further clarification or assistance, please contact me at 31-manager@ics.uci.edu and I will create a script for you given an example of how you store your partner information.

- - scripts/partner_converter.py: This feature is highly customizable as almost every instructor keeps track of this information in different formats. The MOSS GUI will import this file at the start of the program and use it to parse the selected partner file. You need to create your own parsing script so that it parses your partner file correctly. The function must match the given format, but beyond requiring the same name, one keyword argument, and returning the strictly structured information, you may modify the function to your needs. Any parameter you add to the function will be handed to the function as a string, and an entry box will be made for it in the Custom Parameters Panel. For example, if you need to let your script know which assignment to select from the file, or need a supporting file to be handed in, you may create additional parameters that will be filled by whatever you enter in the Custom Parameters Panel.

- - Partners File: Select the file holding the partner information to be passed to the parsing script. You do not have to use this within your function, but you are required to select an existing file in order to continue.

Submission Tab:
- - Report View: This panel gives you a quick overview of how the report turned.

- - New Submission Panel: Used to submit based off of files added to the file manager and other selected settings.

- - - - Choose Directory: Active when downloading a report or archiving. Selects the directory where the report directory is generated.

- - - - Review Report before Archiving: When ticked, after submitting, the program will pause before a download and allow you to edit settings, cancel the download, or continue with the download. Can be ticked to confirm settings are desirable.  Useful to deselect if you want to "set it and forget it".

- - - - Submit: Submits the files in the files tab to moss using the pre-defined settings in the settings tab. Will automatically filter the report if the setting is selected, and will display the results in the report view. Will automatically continue to download or archive the report, if these settings are active, unless "Review before archiving" is selected. Will lock the other panels so that other settings are not changed.

- - - - Archive: Activates when "review report before archiving" is ticked, and the original moss report has been received. Allows you to continue with the download process of the report if the outcome is desirable.

- - - - Edit Settings: Activates when "review report before archiving" is ticked, and the original moss report has been received. Allows you to change settings before continuing with the download process.

- - - - Unlock: Activates after submission is complete. Will unlock other tabs, but will discard memory of submitting. Implemented to prevent the change of settings while still processing a submission.

- - Process Submission Panel: Tools to process already submitted reports via the generated url.
- - - - Original URL: will display the original url generated by your submission. Can also be changed to work with other reports without having to resubmit through the gui.

- - - - Filter Report: will filter the report found at the url entered in the original url textbox.

- - - - Use active partners: when ticked, will indicate to the "Filter Report" button to use the partners found within the partners tab

- - - - Use active files: when ticked, will indicate to the "Filter Report" button to use the files found within the files tab.

- - - - Archive Report: will archive the report found at the url entered in the  original url textbox. If the url matches the last filtered url, then it will archive the filtered report.
